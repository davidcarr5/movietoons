## 4. Our Story (Deep Founder Narrative)

## Our Story: From Notre Dame, Ireland to Movietoons

Movietoons began with a simple idea: what if the moments we love most could feel like the opening scene of our favorite animated movie?

I’m **David Carr**, the founder of Movietoons. I grew up in **Notre Dame, Ireland**, where I spent countless hours watching **Pixar films**, memorizing scenes, and reimagining the world as if it were animated. Those stories, colors, and soundtracks shaped how I saw everything—from family holidays to everyday walks home from school. This passion for the emotional power of animation is the core of our company.

Years later, I founded **Pi-Squared**, a company dedicated to bringing together creativity, technology, and data to build tools that help people tell better stories. Movietoons is the next chapter in that journey: a way to combine cinematic storytelling, animation-inspired visuals, and music into something deeply personal.

Movietoons is about more than editing a video. It’s about emotion. It’s about taking the raw clips from your phone and turning them into something that feels like a movie trailer for your life. Whether you’re in Ireland, the US, or anywhere in the world, I want you to experience that sense of wonder I felt as a kid pressing play on a new Pixar film. This is the world where your memories become movies.
