          <h2>Our Story: From Notre Dame, Ireland to Movietoons</h2>
          <p>Movietoons began with a simple idea: what if the moments we love most could feel like the opening scene of our favorite animated movie?</p>
          <p>I’m <strong>David Carr</strong>, the founder of Movietoons. I grew up in <strong>Notre Dame, Ireland</strong>, where I spent countless hours watching <strong>Pixar films</strong>, memorizing scenes, and reimagining the world as if it were animated. Those stories, colors, and soundtracks shaped how I saw everything—from family holidays to everyday walks home from school. This passion for the emotional power of animation is the core of our company.</p>
          <p>Years later, I founded <strong>Pi-Squared</strong>, a company dedicated to bringing together creativity, technology, and data to build tools that help people tell better stories. Movietoons is the next chapter in that journey: a way to combine cinematic storytelling, animation-inspired visuals, and music into something deeply personal.</p>
          <p>Movietoons is about more than editing a video. It’s about emotion. It’s about taking the raw clips from your phone and turning them into something that feels like a movie trailer for your life. Whether you’re in Ireland, the US, or anywhere in the world, I want you to experience that sense of wonder I felt as a kid pressing play on a new Pixar film. This is the world where your memories become movies.</p>
